# Graduate Assessment Centre Teaching Materials

This repository contains material for delivering the HTML/CSS/JS demo for day 1 of the assessment centre. 

## Materials

There are two code directories within this repo:

- [start_point](code/start_point) contains blank HTML, CSS and JS files named to match what is in the notes
- [completed](code/completed) contains the finished site as it would be if the notes are followed verbatim

There are notes available for each stage:

- [HTML](notes/html.md)
- [CSS](notes/css.md)
- [JavaScript](notes/javascript.md)
