# Additional Resources

A big part of this course will be self-directed learning where you will be required to do your own research on some topics, with some guidance from the trainers. With that in mind we have put together some suggestions for further reading which will build on this morning's session. Your task tomorrow will involve building a webpage using the technologies we have already discussed today, so if there are any areas you feel you need more knowledge in you could look into them. Alternatively, if you feel comfortable with everything covered today you could investigate some more advanced topics which interest you. We've given you some suggested reading below.

Some of these topics will be more helpful than others for tomorrow. If you are unsure where to start we suggest:

- Try downloading an image to your laptop and replacing the placeholder with it.
- Think about some of the other ways in which you could style the blog posts - maybe rounded corners would look nicer? How about changing the size of the text?
- The header is still a bit messy, try using Flexbox to get the list on the same line as the heading.
- ...maybe even try getting each link on the same line!
- Add a form to the bottom of the page where the user can add a new post. It doesn't need to actually add the post, though!
- Read the notes on accessibility under the HTML heading below and ensure your form follows the good practice set out there.
- Style your form. This would be a good opportunity to find out more about the `div` element and its uses in applying CSS.
- Add a "save to favourites" button to the posts. Using JavaScript, add an event listener which changes the background colour of the post. You'll need to do a bit more research into **events** for this one.
- Us JavaScript to add a new element to the page. Modify the "save to favourites" function to add a star icon to the post (you can find the unicode for various stars [here](https://unicode-table.com/en/sets/star-symbols/))
- As you add the star, try to position it in the top right corner of the post.
- If you're feeling *really* adventurous, use JavaScript to add a new post to the page when you click the form's "submit" button (investigating the `preventDefault` function will help here).
